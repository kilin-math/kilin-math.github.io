This semester I taught a new course, **Basic Concepts in Mathematics**, at the Guangdong Technion â€“ Israel Institute of Technology, Shantou.  
It was written as a *diary* of mathematical ideas, proofs, and stories â€” not only to help students learn to prove things, but also to show how mathematicians *think*.

The complete text of the course is available here:

### ðŸ§© Structure of the course

* **Methods of proving** â€” parity, induction, invariants, pigeonhole principle.  
* **Naive set theory** â€” unions, intersections, Cartesian products, Venn diagrams.  
* **Number theory and equivalence** â€” remainders, congruences, countable sets.  
* **Orders and induction on pairs** â€” lexicographic order, minimal counterexamples.

### ðŸ’¬ Collaboration and AI

Students were encouraged to collaborate and to use AI **only as a reviewer, not as an author**.  
The diary includes a full section explaining how to:
1. attempt each problem before asking for help,  
2. use AI to improve clarity,  
3. reflect on understanding and learning process.
