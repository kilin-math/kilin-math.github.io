This semester I am teaching a new course, **Basic Concepts in Mathematics**, 
at the Guangdong Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, Shantou.  
The notes will be written as a *diary* for teachers.

The complete text of the course will be updated here:

### Structure of the course

* **Methods of proving** — parity, induction, invariants, pigeonhole principle.  
* **Naive set theory** — unions, intersections, Cartesian products, Venn diagrams.  
* **Number theory and equivalence** — remainders, congruences, countable/uncountable sets.  
* **Orders and lexicographic induction** — lexicographic order.

### Collaboration and AI

Students were encouraged to collaborate and to use AI **only as a reviewer, not as an author**.  
The diary includes a full section explaining how to:
1. attempt each problem before asking for help,  
2. use AI to improve clarity,  
3. reflect on understanding and learning process.
