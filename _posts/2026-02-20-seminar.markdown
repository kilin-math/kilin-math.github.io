### Talks

#### Subconvexity for twisted GL(3) L-functions

**Speaker:** Chan leong Kuan (Sun Yat-sen University)  
**Time:** TBA  

**Abstract:**  
Using a variant of circle method and conductor lowering trick
originally devised by Munshi, we obtain subconvex bounds for twisted
GL(3) L-functions, in the character and \(t\)-aspects simultaneously.
This is joint work with E.M. Kıral and D. Lesesvre.

#### Some results on classical and adelic Eisenstein series

**Speaker:** Shaoyun Yi (Xiamen University)  
**Time:** TBC  

**Abstract:**  
In this talk, we will discuss the classical Siegel Eisenstein series
of weight \(k\) and degree \(2\) within an adelic framework, mainly applying the
method known as “Hecke summation”. In the process, we recover the clas-
sical Fourier expansion of the Siegel Eisenstein series from an adelic point
of view. One of our goals is to determine the automorphic representations
associated to these Siegel Eisenstein series, particularly for the case of weight
\(k = 2\), where the underlying global representation is highly reducible.

First, we will give a quick introduction to the necessary background and
motivation for this work. Next, we will briefly review recent results in the
study of classical and adelic Eisenstein series for GL(2) (the degree \(1\) case),
which may be viewed as a toy example. Finally, we will present an overview
of our ongoing work on the Siegel Eisenstein series of degree \(2\). These are
joint works with Manami Roy and Ralf Schmidt.

#### Artin's primitive root conjecture: classically and over algebraic function fields

**Speaker:** Ezra Waxman  
**Time:** TBA  

**Abstract:**  
Fix \(g \in \mathbb{N}\) such that \(g\) is not a perfect square. Artin's primitive root
conjecture (1927) states that there exist infinitely many primes
\(p \in \mathbb{N}\) such that \(g\) generates the finite cyclic group
\((\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}\). Nearly a century later, Artin's conjecture
remains wide-open: in fact there is no known specified \(g\) for which the
conjecture has been resolved.

As the centennial of Artin’s conjecture approaches, we survey its rich
history and introduce several new variants of the problem. Specifically,
we discuss an “Artin Twin Primes Conjecture” and prove an appropriate
analogue of Artin's conjecture for algebraic function fields.
