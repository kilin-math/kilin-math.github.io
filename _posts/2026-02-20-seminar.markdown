### Talks

#### Subconvexity for twisted GL(3) L-functions

**Speaker:** Chan leong Kuan (Sun Yat-sen University)  
**Time:** TBA  

**Abstract:**  
Using a variant of circle method and conductor lowering trick
originally devised by Munshi, we obtain subconvex bounds for twisted
GL(3) L-functions, in the character and \(t\)-aspects simultaneously.
This is joint work with E.M. Kıral and D. Lesesvre.

#### Sign changes of Fourier coefficients on GL(m).

**Speaker:** Yingnan Wang  
**Time:** TBA  

**Abstract:**  
 In this talk, we will survey some results on sign changes of Fourier coefficients 
 (Hecke eigenvalues) of holomorphic Hecke eigenforms on GL_2 and Hecke-Maass forms on GL_m (m>=2). 
 Then we will introduce some statistical results on sign changes of Fourier 
 coefficients of Hecke-Maass forms on GL_m (m>=3). For most Hecke-Maass cusp forms, 
 we give the asymptotic number of nonvanishing coefficients, show that there is a 
 positive proportion of sign changes among them, when these are real, and describe 
 the asymptotic density of these signs. This talk is based on a joint work with 
 Didier Lesesvre and Ming Ho Ng

#### Distribution of the error term in the Dirichlet divisor problem

**Speaker:** Yuk-Kam Lau  
**Time:** TBA  

**Abstract:**  
 Three decades ago, Heath-Brown resolved the question of whether a limiting 
 distribution function exists for the normalized error term in the Dirichlet divisor problem. 
 In this talk, we will review his groundbreaking work and the subsequent developments. 
 In particular, we will discuss recent advances by Lamzouri.



#### Some results on classical and adelic Eisenstein series

**Speaker:** Shaoyun Yi (Xiamen University)  
**Time:** TBA  

**Abstract:**  
In this talk, we will discuss the classical Siegel Eisenstein series
of weight \(k\) and degree \(2\) within an adelic framework, mainly applying the
method known as “Hecke summation”. In the process, we recover the classical 
Fourier expansion of the Siegel Eisenstein series from an adelic point
of view. One of our goals is to determine the automorphic representations
associated to these Siegel Eisenstein series, particularly for the case of weight
\(k = 2\), where the underlying global representation is highly reducible.

First, we will give a quick introduction to the necessary background and
motivation for this work. Next, we will briefly review recent results in the
study of classical and adelic Eisenstein series for GL(2) (the degree \(1\) case),
which may be viewed as a toy example. Finally, we will present an overview
of our ongoing work on the Siegel Eisenstein series of degree \(2\). These are
joint works with Manami Roy and Ralf Schmidt.

#### Zeta-series for convex domains and its pole at s=2/3

**Speaker:** Nikita Kalinin (Guangdong Technion-Israel Institute of Technology)  
**Time:** TBA  

**Abstract:**  
Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^2$ be a bounded convex domain. To $\Omega$ we associate a Dirichlet-type series
\[
F_\Omega(s)=\sum_{v\in\mathbb Z^2} f_\Omega(v)^s,
\]
where the sum ranges over primitive lattice vectors and $f_\Omega(v)$ 
is a natural weight determined by the support function of $\Omega$ in directions of $v$ and $x_v, y_v$ where $x_v+y_v=v$ and $det(u,v)=1$. 
Beyond its lattice-geometric origin, $F_\Omega(s)$ exhibits a modular symmetry: 
it is $SL(2,\mathbb Z)$-invariant up to explicitly controlled holomorphic correction terms.

We prove that $F_\Omega(s)$ admits a meromorphic continuation to the half-plane $\Re(s)> \tfrac12$, 
and that it has a \emph{simple pole} at $s=\tfrac23$. 
The leading term is geometric: the residue at $s=\tfrac23$ is proportional to the \emph{affine length} 
of $\partial\Omega$ (the equi-affine perimeter), revealing a new bridge between analytic continuation of lattice sums 
and affine differential geometry of convex curves.

Joint work with M.~Shkolnikov and E.~Lupercio.

#### Artin's primitive root conjecture: classically and over algebraic function fields

**Speaker:** Ezra Waxman  
**Time:** TBA  

**Abstract:**  
Fix $g \in \mathbb{N}$ such that \(g\) is not a perfect square. Artin's primitive root
conjecture (1927) states that there exist infinitely many primes
$p \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $g$ generates the finite cyclic group
$(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$. Nearly a century later, Artin's conjecture
remains wide-open: in fact there is no known specified $g$ for which the
conjecture has been resolved.

As the centennial of Artin’s conjecture approaches, we survey its rich
history and introduce several new variants of the problem. Specifically,
we discuss an “Artin Twin Primes Conjecture” and prove an appropriate
analogue of Artin's conjecture for algebraic function fields.
