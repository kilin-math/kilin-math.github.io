**Talks in Sofia about telescoping over topographs**


Better to start with Cormac C'Sullivan Topographs and some infinite series [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZtSAlNT810) on Youtube. 


I gave a talk (first out of three) at [ICMS](https://icms.bg/event/three-lectures-on-binary-quadratic-forms-and-conways-topographs-by-nikita-kalinin-part-one/), Sofia.
[Here](/assets/numbers/telescopic_presentation1.pdf) is the slides.

[video](https://youtu.be/z7Pz33JyCuA) is also available.

[Here](/assets/numbers/telescopic_presentation2.pdf) is the slides of the second talk.

**Added 22 July 2025:** I finished the first [draft](/assets/numbers/telescopic.pdf) draft of the article!
