> “What is the most important thing a scientist should cultivate in himself? 
> One should get rid of excessive ambition. One should not think that only a genius can be happy. 
> One must learn to appreciate even a small achievement, 
> to rejoice in it, and never overestimate oneself. One has to cultivate a love for work. 
> One has to understand and cultivate the joy of learning, which is almost the same as the joy of life.
>  Happiness is when your life’s work is needed.” Sobolev, Sergei Lvovich
