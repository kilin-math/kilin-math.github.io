A recent [review](https://hal.science/hal-05052554v1/file/review-spbmath.pdf) of the volume [Saint Petersburg Mathematicians and Their Discoveries](https://sites.google.com/view/spbmath)
(also available in Russian, [Математики Санкт-Петербурга и их открытия. Сборник статей](https://biblio.mccme.ru/node/291128)
 
asks whether Bunyakovsky’s name should appear in what is usually called the Cauchy–Bunyakovsky–Schwarz inequality.  


For a deeper historical perspective, see S. Kichenassamy’s lecture 
[]“The Cauchy-Bunyakovsky inequality and its mathematical interpretations,”](https://www.mathnet.ru/php/seminars.phtml?option_lang=eng&presentid=30018) complete with slides.


Kichenassamy develops these ideas further in his article [“Apodictic discourse and the Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19543) 
published in *Gaṇita Bhāratī 42 (1), 2020, 1–19*.

> *“The various interpretations of Bunyakovsky’s inequality are therefore not logical developments of a single idea. 
Unlike nested Matryoshka dolls, each of which is a copy of the next one, only smaller, the sequence of these 
inequalities rather resembles Fabergé eggs, each containing a ‘surprise’ entirely different from the outer shape… 
Historical investigation provides a deeper understanding of modern mathematics that cannot be inferred from the modern stage alone.”*  

This evocative Fabergé-egg metaphor is one of the most striking images in the paper and captures the layered—but not necessarily nested—evolution of the inequality over time.
